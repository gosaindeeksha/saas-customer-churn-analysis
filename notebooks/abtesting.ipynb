    "## A/B Testing Design — Friction Reduction Experiment\n",
    "\n",
    "### Objective\n",
    "\n",
    "Behavioral cohort analysis and churn risk modeling indicate that **early churn is driven by product friction among highly engaged trial users**, rather than by lack of activation.  \n",
    "The objective of this experiment is to evaluate whether **reducing early friction** for at-risk trial users can meaningfully reduce early churn.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Target Population\n",
    "\n",
    "The experiment targets **high-risk trial users**, defined as users in the **top 30% of predicted churn risk** based on the logistic regression risk model.\n",
    "\n",
    "This population was selected because:\n",
    "- It exhibits a significantly higher baseline churn rate (~70%)\n",
    "- It concentrates churn risk, improving experimental efficiency\n",
    "- It represents users whose experience is still malleable during the trial period\n",
    "\n",
    "> *Note: The 30% cutoff is illustrative given dataset size. In production, this threshold would be tuned based on traffic volume and experiment power.*\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Experiment Hypothesis\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Null Hypothesis (H₀):**  \n",
    "  Reducing early product friction does not change early churn rates among high-risk trial users.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Alternative Hypothesis (H₁):**  \n",
    "  Reducing early product friction lowers early churn rates among high-risk trial users.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Treatment Description\n",
    "\n",
    "Users in the treatment group would receive **friction-reduction interventions** during their first 30 days, such as:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Guided walkthroughs for complex features\n",
    "- Improved error messaging and recovery suggestions\n",
    "- Reduced exposure to unstable or beta features\n",
    "- Contextual in-app help triggered by error events\n",
    "\n",
    "The control group would continue to receive the existing onboarding and product experience.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Randomization Strategy (Conceptual)\n",
    "\n",
    "High-risk trial users would be randomly assigned into control and treatment groups.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Conceptual example \n",
    "high_risk_users[\"experiment_group\"] = np.random.choice(\n",
    "    [\"control\", \"treatment\"],\n",
    "    size=len(high_risk_users),\n",
    "    p=[0.5, 0.5]\n",
    ")\n",
    "```\n",
    "---\n",
    "###  Primary Success Metric\n",
    "Early churn rate, defined as the proportion of users who churn within the early lifecycle window.\n",
    "$$\\text{Early Churn Rate} = \\frac{\\text{Early Churned Users}}{\\text{Total Users}}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Secondary Metrics (used to validate the intervention mechanism)\n",
    "\n",
    "- Errors per active day\n",
    "\n",
    "- Number of error events in the first 30 days\n",
    "\n",
    "- Feature success rate during early usage ($\\text{feature success rate} = \\frac{\\text{no. of time feature completed succesfully}}{\\text{no. of times users used the feature}}$)\n",
    "\n",
    "These metrics will help confirm whether the treatment reduces friction, even before churn outcomes fully materialize.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Statistical Evaluation Plan\n",
    "\n",
    "If deployed, experiment outcomes would be evaluated using:\n",
    "\n",
    "- A two-proportion z-test comparing early churn rates between treatment and control groups\n",
    "\n",
    "- Significance assessed at α = 0.05\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally:\n",
    "\n",
    "Power analysis would be conducted upfront to estimate minimum detectable effect size\n",
    "\n",
    "Confidence intervals would be reported alongside point estimates\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    ">**Note:** Due to the observational and synthetic nature of this dataset, statistical tests are not executed in this project. This section outlines the evaluation framework that would be applied in a production environment\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Limitations\n",
    "\n",
    "- The dataset is synthetic and limited in size\n",
    "\n",
    "- The experiment is designed conceptually and not executed\n",
    "\n",
    "- Results are intended to demonstrate experimental thinking and design\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Expected Impact\n",
    "\n",
    "By focusing interventions on high-risk, highly engaged trial users, this experiment aims to:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Reduce friction-driven churn\n",
    "\n",
    "- Improve early product experience \n",
    "\n",
    "- Increase the efficiency and signal strength of retention experiments"
